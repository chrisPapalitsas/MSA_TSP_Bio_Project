# A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. #Multiple sequence alignment also refers to the process of aligning such a sequence set. Because three or more sequences of biologically #relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time-consuming to align by hand, computational algorithms are used to produce and #analyze the alignments. MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than pairwise alignment because they are more computationally #complex
#In computer science and mathematical optimization, a metaheuristic is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, #or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem, especially #with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity
#On this effort we use the Travelling Salesman Problem to model  the multiple sequence alignment problem and try to sovle it via modern #
#quantum inspired metaheuristic version, which is based on Variable Neighborhood Seach .


#On this section, will follow some notes regarding the project..
